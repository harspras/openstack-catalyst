The catalyst plugin is in compatible to cisco's v2 blueprint
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/9988/ for nexus and ucs plugin. For it to work
, the l2network v2 files of the blueprint should be used. Other v2 files are
the ones we created for v2 as cisco's v2 version was not available at that
time. The l2network_plugin_v2.py would now be network_plugin.py and similarily
for other files. Please refer the blueprint at the above url.
